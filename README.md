- 👋 Hello!
- 👀 I’m interested in music, various tech, keyboards, 3D modeling and printing, and programming.
- 🎓 Bachelors of Science in Cybersecurity, graduated in 2019.
- 🎓 Associates of Science in Computer Electronics Networking Technology, graduated in 2016.
- 🎓 Starting another Bachelor's degree in May, 2025.
- 🛠️ Currently studying for Linux Essentials. Should be easy but I want to ace it lol.
- 💻 I daily-drive Arch btw, but also study in Kubuntu, RHEL/CentOS, and MacOS. I use Windows for 3D printing, Unity modeling, and programming keyboards with my favorite AtMega32u4 microcontrollers.
- ⭐ Recent Personal Accomplishments in January, 2024: Finished the 537 page "Linux for Dummies" book, and Jason Dion's 010-160 Udemy course, and "Linux Mastery" which is about Linux terminal commands from Ziya Yehia. It's been 12 years since I first used Linux, but I've been daily-driving Linux for 1 year now!
- 🌱 Personal Goals for February-May, 2025: Obtain the Linux Essentials certification, then speedrun the ITF+, regain my old Apple Certified Technician certs, then speedrun the A+. After this period, I'll be working on the second Bachelor's degree and maybe going for the Net+, Sec+, LPI+, and the RHCSA.
- 🌱 Not quite a "programmer" yet, especially while I am focused on other IT topics this first half of the year, but hope to have things to share towards the end of the year. For now, you'll find the deploy scripts and configuration files I use for several different areas of interest, and a small little Python program I wrote to help with figuring out just-intonation frequencies for playing fretless instruments.
