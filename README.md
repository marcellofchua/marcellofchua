- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marcellofchua
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in music, various tech, keyboards, 3D modeling and printing, and learning to code.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Java, InTune, SharePoint Online, Linux tinkering, and a how to write a tiling window manager in Windows.
- ðŸš§ My private GitHub for learning and experimenting is not here or connected to this account.
- ðŸš§ Expect mostly files I needed to share with my friends that are building computers at the moment and are new to Linux.
- ðŸš§ Coding projects will show up more often over time as I improved my skills.
- ðŸš§ There will be lots of How-To Guides though, both for me and anyone that needed help with a specific thing.
