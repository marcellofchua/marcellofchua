- ðŸš§ THIS REPOSITORY IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. The Git account I use for school and experimenting is Private.
- ðŸš§ Expect finished projects and on-going projects that are actually interesting or useful here.
- ðŸš§ I will also be hosting many How-To guides for various tech and music things as I update them with newer versions.
